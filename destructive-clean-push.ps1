# destructive-clean-push.ps1
# WARNING: Destructive operations. Read comments before running.
#
# What this does:
# - Copies your current working tree to a clean folder (excluding .git)
# - Initializes a new git repo, makes a single commit with the provided author
# - Force-pushes that commit to https://github.com/akhilesh-reddy2005/campusbus.git (replaces remote history)
# - Deletes all remote branches except 'main'
# - Deletes all remote tags
# - Removes collaborators via GitHub CLI (keeps owner and the authenticated user)
#
# Requirements:
# - git installed and on PATH
# - gh (GitHub CLI) installed and authenticated (for collaborator removal)
# - You must be repository admin and able to force-push or temporarily disable branch protection

# -------- CONFIG (you can change these paths if needed) --------
